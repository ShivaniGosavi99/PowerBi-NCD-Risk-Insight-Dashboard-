# Global NCD Risk & Survival Insight Dashboard

## Problem Statement

This Power BI dashboard that provides a comprehensive analysis of noncommunicable disease (NCD) risks, survival insights, and related health outcomes across five countries: Japan, United States, India, South Korea, and Switzerland. The dashboard visualizes critical metrics such as disease prevalence, mortality, treatment coverage, and demographic breakdowns, offering valuable insights for public health decision-making and research.

Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs)—including cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes—are the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, responsible for at least 43 million deaths in 2021, or 75% of all non-pandemic-related deaths globally. NCDs not only cause immense human suffering but also result in significant economic losses, costing hundreds of billions of dollars annually and disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries, where 73% of NCD deaths and 82% of premature deaths (before age 70) occur.

Given the scale and complexity of the NCD epidemic, robust data-driven insights are essential. High-quality, comprehensive data enables policymakers and health systems to identify the most pressing health challenges, allocate resources efficiently, track progress toward global targets, and design effective interventions tailored to specific populations. Leveraging data also helps uncover disparities, monitor risk factors, and evaluate the impact of prevention and treatment strategies, ultimately supporting efforts to reduce the global burden of NCDs and improve health outcomes for all


Key Features and Insights:

Country-wise NCD Prevalence:
The dashboard displays the percentage of major NCDs—cancer, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, and diabetes—for each country. This allows users to compare disease burden and identify countries with higher or lower prevalence rates, supporting global benchmarking and targeted health interventions.

Demographic Analysis (Male/Female Averages):
By breaking down data by gender, the dashboard highlights disparities in NCD risk and outcomes between males and females. This is crucial for understanding vulnerable populations and tailoring prevention strategies.

Mortality Metrics:
Total Mortality Rate: Shows the overall rate of deaths attributable to NCDs in each country, enabling cross-country comparisons.
Sum of Premature Deaths: Focuses on deaths occurring before age 70, a key indicator for evaluating the effectiveness of early intervention and public health policies.
Average Deaths: Provides a normalized view of NCD-related deaths, useful for comparing countries with different population sizes.


NCD Treatment Coverage Rate:
The dashboard aggregates and visualizes the sum of treatment coverage rates for NCDs, reflecting each country's healthcare system performance in managing these diseases. Higher coverage rates indicate better access to and utilization of essential health services.

Survival Insights:
By integrating survival analysis techniques, the dashboard estimates survival probabilities for different NCDs, offering a time-based perspective on patient outcomes. This can help identify trends in disease management and the impact of interventions over time

why India has higher percentage of non-communicable diseases than South Korea Japan Switzerland United States.

Key Reasons:

Higher Prevalence of Risk Factors:
Tobacco use, unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, and harmful alcohol consumption are all rising in India

Obesity, elevated blood pressure, and raised blood glucose levels are increasingly common.

Physical inactivity is particularly high: more than two-thirds of Indian adolescents and over 30% of adults are sedentary.

Socioeconomic and Urbanization Factors:

Rapid urbanization and economic changes have led to lifestyle shifts that increase NCD risk

Healthcare System Limitations:

India’s healthcare system faces challenges in early detection, continuous management, and effective prevention of NCDs

Comparison with High-Income Countries:

South Korea, Japan, and Switzerland are high-income countries with robust public health systems, better preventive care, and healthier population habits, resulting in lower NCD risk and mortality
